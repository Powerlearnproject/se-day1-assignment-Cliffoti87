Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering 

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Its an engineering principle that uses tools and methods to develop and maintaing high quality softwares. Its important as softwares are now becoming an integral part of life through commerce, technology etc.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Enhanced Communitication through development of communication apps.
Enhanced Speed through development of faster and more agile softwares.
More Better Programming through advent of more sophisticated yet simple programming languages.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requiremenets what is needed.
Design how it needs to look like.
Implementation writing and building according to design.
Deployment releasing it to the market.
Maintenance Regularly updating and checking for bugs.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall follows a strict flow of ideas from top to bottom, best scenario to use if a project doesn't require changes once implementation has started.
Agile follows a more relaxed approach in building and is open to changes along the way, best scenario to use if a project is undefined at the onset and is more likely to change when oncourse.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer writes the codes and implements software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer ensures codes are of high standards by testing them.
Project Manager Oversees planning, execution and delivery of softwares.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provide tools for writing and testing codes eg. Visual Studio
VCS track changes in codes and provides coordination work amongst team members

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing Requirements Use of agile methodologies which are versatile and opem to changes along the way.
Tight Deadlines Priotizations and reassesment of timelines.
Tecgnical Debts Use effective communication to know exactly what is needed.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit test individual components of softwares, its importance is that we can detect a bug early and correct it.
Intergration tests how individual components work in a group, its importance is that it can help us catch bugs that happen when components interact with each other.
Sytem testing the entire system and see how it works ensuring compliance, its importance is that it covers the entire system from end to end to see how it would work in the real world.
Acceptance testing done to determine whether the softawre meets the acceptance criteria before final release, its importance is that it gives user validation, final check before software is released.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
This is a way of creating questions and instructions to the machine that would produce the best responses. Importance is that clear direct prompts gives clear and optimzed outputs thus enhancing user experience.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Write a math test for grade five Vague prompt
Write a math test on Algebra for grade five Improved
The improved version would write a test on algebra focussing only on the skills capabilities of grade fives students.
